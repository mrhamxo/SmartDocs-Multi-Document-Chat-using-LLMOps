Question: what is R language and where we used it?,"R is a free, open‑source programming language designed for statistical computing and graphics. It is the preferred tool for academic statisticians and data scientists, enabling the implementation of a wide range of statistical methods and the creation of plots, models, and simulations. R is used for data analysis, model building, and visualizing results in research, industry, and education."
define and explain predictive model?,A predictive model is a statistical algorithm that uses one or more predictor variables to estimate or forecast the value of a response variable. It learns the relationship between predictors and the response from training data—often via techniques like linear regression—and then applies that learned relationship to new data to make predictions. The model’s usefulness is judged by how well it explains the response and how accurately it predicts unseen observations.
what is unsupervised learning?," Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the data have no labeled outputs, so the algorithm must discover patterns, structure, or groupings on its own—such as clustering or dimensionality‑reduction techniques—without a known “true answer” to validate against."
